## Step 5 — Prompt Creation for Metadata and Story

In addition to the geometric reconstruction pipeline, each object in the dataset
includes a textual description generated through a structured prompting process.

This step captures the **artistic, cultural, and emotional context** of each
kintsugi or yobitsugi piece—information that cannot be expressed through 3D shape
or color alone.

The prompt consists of two main components:

---

### A. Metadata (Objective Information)

Structured factual attributes describing the ceramic object:

- **Material / texture** of the plate  
- **Color of the kintsugi lines**  
- **Brand or kiln**, place of origin, region  
- **Date or era** when it was produced  
- **Intentionality of the break** (accidental, natural aging, etc.)

This information helps ground the object within its historical and cultural
background.

---

### B. Story (Subjective Information)

Narrative elements conveying the emotion and meaning behind the repair:

- The **reason** the piece was repaired  
- The **workshop or environment** where the repair was performed  
- The **values or philosophy** guiding the kintsugi  
- How the **creator felt** during the restoration process

This part reflects the human-centered aspect of kintsugi and allows the dataset
to include cultural richness beyond geometric reconstruction.
